    """
    VARIANT FUNCTION - more of an exampole.
    Constructs the QPIXL circuit.
    This function takes an input image represented as a grayscale array, compresses it
    based on the specified compression ratio, and generates a quantum circuit that
    encodes the image. The circuit can optionally include pre- and post-pattern operations around controlled rotations.
    Args:
        a (numpy.ndarray): Grayscale image represented as a 1D array of pixel intensities.
        compression (float): Compression ratio as a percentage (0-100). Determines the
                                proportion of smallest absolute values in the image data
                                to set to zero.
        pre_pattern (callable, optional): A function that applies a custom operation
                                            to the circuit before a controlled rotation.
                                            Defaults to None.
        post_pattern (callable, optional): A function that applies a custom operation
                                            to the circuit after a controlled rotation.
                                            Defaults to None.
    Returns:
        QuantumCircuit: A quantum circuit implementing the compressed FRQI representation
                        of the input image.
    Notes:
        - The input array is first converted to angles and preprocessed.
        - The Walsh-Hadamard Transform (WHT) is applied to the data, followed by
            a Gray code permutation.
        - The smallest absolute values in the transformed data are set to zero based on
            the compression parameter.
